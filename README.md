I have created Time management assistant/study planner tool. 
Student Planner & Study Tracker(Reafme file)
**Description**
So this is my Student Planner tool, it's a program I made in Python that runs in the command line. Basically, it's to help students like me keep track of all their studying and assignments.
University is pretty chaotic and it's super easy to forget what you've actually studied. I made this as a kind of digital notebook where you can log what you studied, for which subject, and see your progress. It saves everything to a simple file on your computer, so your data is still there when you open the program again. It's meant to help you stay a bit more organised.
**Features**
•	Easy Logging: You can quickly add a new study session by just typing the subject and the topic you studied. It's made to be fast so you don't waste time.
•	Automatic Date: The program automatically adds the current date for every entry. You don't have to type it, which is good because I always get the format wrong.
•	View Your Tasks: You can see all your study logs in a nice table. It helps you see what you've been working on and what you might have ignored.
•	Saves Your Data: It uses a normal text file (planner_data.txt) to save all your entries. So you can close the program and your stuff will still be there next time.
•	Simple Interface: It's just a text menu in the terminal. It's not fancy but it's fast and there's nothing to distract you.
**How to Run It**
1.	What You Need: You just need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. (Most Macs have it already, Windows users might need to download it).
2.	Get the File: Download the study_planner.py file and put it in a folder somewhere you'll remember.
3.	Open Terminal: Open up your command prompt or terminal.
4.	Find the Folder: Use the cd command to navigate to the folder where you saved the python file. (This bit is sometimes tricky).
5.	Run it! Type the command below and press enter:
